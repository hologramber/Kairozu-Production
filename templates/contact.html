        <p>Please remember that <span class="underline">this is not a professional endeavor</span>. I have a normal job that is 100% unrelated to Kairozu. I built this as a fun side project and thus it changes form and function frequently. I don't guarantee that the site will exist tomorrow.</p>
        <p>Before you send me a grammar-related comment/fix/request, don't forget that many of the sentences are primarily built to assist with practicing specific grammar constructs. They might sound awkward, or you might never use them in a normal conversation, but if they're grammatically correct they're okay. That said, I'm happy to receive grammar fixes because I'll undoubtedly learn something at the same time -- if you wouldn't mind explaining why you believe something is wrong, I'd appreciate it. Thanks in advance!</p>
        <p>If you run into a technical error, I'd also love to hear about it. <span class="bold">Please include your browser & OS version</span>, and what you were doing when the error occurred.</p>
        {% if user.is_authenticated %}
            <p>Bug reports of all varieties can be submitted from the Kairozu dropdown menu on the navigation bar above, or you can send me an email at kairozu@kairozu.com. Most sections of the site which accept input (sentences, quizzes, etc), will include an "error?" link when an incorrect answer is attempted -- these can also be used to submit reports. To keep the site issues database from going up in flames, reports are limited to 15 per person/per day (I hope I haven't broken things _that_ badly).</p>
            <p>If you're angry that I accidentally taught you to say that you like eating cats for breakfast, well, I tried to warn you. Suck it up and register for a real Japanese class from native speakers at your local community college or university. That is the best way to learn. This is the worst way to learn.</p>
        {% endif %}
        <p>Other comments/questions/so forth are welcome, but again -- this isn't my job -- so please don't expect an expedient reply.</p>
