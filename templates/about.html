    <h1>始めまして､&#32;I'm Kairozu.</h1>

    <p>Kairozu has taken many forms; it is currently developed as an open source project and maintained for the benefit of existing users and their data.</p>
    <p>Kairozu uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmed_learning">programmed learning</a> to build an understanding of Japanese grammar using English-to-Japanese sentence construction. Grammatical constructs are introduced in small, logical steps, which are organized by chapter around groups of new vocabulary words.</p>
    <p>I find Socratic and programmed methods of inquiry to be particularly effective when it comes to retaining information -- my two favorite examples are <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sidmans-Neuroanatomy-Programmed-Learning-Lippincott/dp/0781765684/">Sidman's Neuroanatomy: A Programmed Learning Tool</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Little-Schemer-Daniel-P-Friedman/dp/0262560992/">The Little Schemer</a>. Here I've tried to minimize wordy grammar explanations and maximize immediate application of small grammar templates, which are then built upon word by word (or particle by particle).</p>
    <p>The lessons are an attempt to organize the grammar into an easily-referenced format. Most of the Japanese sentences are computer-generated using common words and grammar patterns compiled from Japanese-language sources aimed at beginners, namely NHK Easy News, 福娘, 毎日小学生新聞, 毎日１５歳のニュース, 朝日小学生新聞, 朝日中学生新聞, and FNN News.</p>
