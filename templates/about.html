    <h1>初めまして、I'm Kairozu.</h1>

    <p>Kairozu uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmed_learning">programmed learning</a> to build an understanding of Japanese grammar using English-to-Japanese sentence construction. Grammatical constructs are introduced in small, logical steps, which are organized by chapter around groups of new vocabulary words.</p>
    <p>I find Socratic and programmed methods of inquiry to be particularly effective when it comes to retaining information -- my two favorite examples are <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sidmans-Neuroanatomy-Programmed-Learning-Lippincott/dp/0781765684/">Sidman's Neuroanatomy: A Programmed Learning Tool</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Little-Schemer-Daniel-P-Friedman/dp/0262560992/">The Little Schemer</a>. Here I've tried to minimize wordy grammar explanations and maximize immediate application of small grammar templates, which are then built upon word by word (or particle by particle).</p>
    <p>I am not a teacher, a programmer, or a designer, nor do I speak Japanese natively. Let's be clear: learning a language from someone that is ALSO learning the language is <strike>perhaps not the brightest idea</strike> A TERRIBLE IDEA. I've <strike>probably</strike> DEFINITELY made mistakes and it would be unfortunate if you internalized my mistakes as grammar fact. Building things and trying to explain them to someone else helps me learn, which is to say <span class="bold">I made this for myself</span>.  <span class="bold">Use and learn incorrect things at your own risk</span>.</p>
    <p>The lessons are my attempt to organize the grammar I've learned into a format I can easily reference. Most of the Japanese sentences are computer-generated using common words and grammar patterns compiled from Japanese-language sources aimed at beginners, namely NHK Easy News, 福娘, 毎日小学生新聞, 毎日１５歳のニュース, 朝日小学生新聞, 朝日中学生新聞, and FNN News. I talk more about my adventures in analyzing Japanese text on the <a href="{% url 'news:main' %}">Kairozu blog</a>.</p>
